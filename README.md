# 1ppm
Public repository for my "1 project per month" challenge.

---

I liked the idea when I saw it on HackerNews. I changed it a little bit for myself: Instead of creating a new project every month, I'll first try to fix/finish the existing ones, and then move on to the new projects. Here, I'll keep my list and try to finish them as much as possible.
